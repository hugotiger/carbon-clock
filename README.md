# Carbon Clock

A simple webpage showing how much CO<sub>2</sub> can be released into the atmosphere to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C. It is heavily inspired by [MCC's version](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html).

## How it's calculated
The full calculation can be seen in `calc.ts`. Short summary is that it's an interpolation of data from the IPCC.
